# Based Agent Template

This repo provides a template for a NextJS app that can be deployed to Phala Cloud.

The app will derive it's own NEAR account, in memory based on the TEE hardware (or use a NEAR dev account for local development).

The app can verify itself against the NEAR contract `dcap.magical-part.testnet`.

## Coming Soon

[] - add NEAR contract to repo
[] - add balance to NEAR account

## How to deploy to Phala Cloud

WIP

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
